# Untold Stories

This WordPress Blog Theme was originally built by [CSSIgniter](https://www.cssigniter.com/). However, support has seemingly ended in 2023, with the theme being removed from both their own website and the Themeforest storefront.

The theme is still actively used on [kawaii-blog.org](https://www.kawaii-blog.org/), so I've decided to continue supporting it by myself.

## What's changed?

You can probably just drop this theme into your own website if you have the original release installed. It's a little different from it, though:

- a translation to de_DE (informal) has been added, with some new strings
- post thumbnails are a little more high-res and uncropped (run [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) if you experience problems)
- custom theme styles have been removed from the backend editor
- a page template for browsing recipes has been added ([see it in action here](https://www.kawaii-blog.org/recipes/))
- with AntiSpambee installed and comments enabled, a spam count will be displayed in the comment box
- a page template for displaying all of the posts you ever made (and their comment count) has been added ([see it in action here](https://www.kawaii-blog.org/archiv/))
- a modded "About me" widget has been added, which will display your bio image in higher resolution and uncropped (it's more like a Polaroid style)
- Google Fonts have been replaced with local fonts
- Images in the Classic Editor will be inserted by default in medium size and hotlinked to the image file, so they can be used with a lightbox
- added a few core WordPress tweaks
  - reenabled infinite scrolling in the media library
  - suppressed the Site Health widget
  - disabled the Gutenberg editor in widget management
- added a post taxonomy "recipe-categories" which will be used in future on the recipe page template
- made a few CSS tweaks
  - hiding the post image on featured posts
  - fixing the footer padding/margin)
